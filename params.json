Install Mono runtime environment.\r\n 2. Install one or more Serial monitoring software. \r\n 3. Done! Now you have everything setup for development!\r\n\r\nDirectory Layout\r\n----------------------\r\n - **Projects:** holds all of the projects. \r\n    - The path to the main.cpp file to edit for each project is located at `Projects/*insert project name*/L5_Application/main.cpp`\r\n - **gcc-arm-none-eabi-*:** Binaries needed to compile the SJSU One sources code to ARM compatiable hex files. *Path to this folder is added when building using build.sh*\r\n - **ref_and_datasheets:** References and Datasheets about the SJSU One board, source code and documentation.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n----------------------\r\n 1. Write your program to the: \r\n        open Projects/*insert project name*/L5_Application/main.cpp\r\n\r\n 2. Build your executable:\r\n\t\tGoto: Projects/*insert project name*/L5_Application/_Build\r\n\t\tRun : build.sh\r\n 3. Load your executable to your board:\r\n\t\tRun: mono Hyperload.exe\r\n        #In Hyperload:\r\n\t\tOpen: Projects/*insert project name*/L5_Application/_Build/Executables/{program name here}.hex\r\n\t\tSelect:\tAppropriate Port\r\n\t\tSelect:\tSpeed (default 38400 - 11520)\r\n\t\tClick:\tSend reset\r\n 4. To view output of board:\r\n        Use: any one of the Serial monitor programs\r\n        Recommended: Hercules & Gtkterm\r\n\r\nVersion\r\n-------\r\n0.1\r\n\r\n**Hope this helps!**\r\n\r\nK.A.M.M.C.E.
